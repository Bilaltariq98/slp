## ✅ Key Decisions Made

- ✅ Skipped Web App Hacker's Handbook (redundant with Bug Bounty Bootcamp)
- ✅ Kept both Alice & Bob books (complementary: one coding, one architecture)
- ✅ Deferred cloud books until Phase 5
- ✅ Skipped Social Engineering (not technical priority)
- ✅ Using free PDF for Security Engineering
