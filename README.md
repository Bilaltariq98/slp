---

## üéì Certifications (Optional - After Phase 3)

_Consider these once you have solid foundational knowledge:_

- **OSCP** (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
    - Gold standard for pentesting
    - Hands-on 24-hour exam
- **eWPT** (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester)
    - Web app focus
    - More accessible than OSCP
- **CEH** (Certified Ethical Hacker)
    - Broader but less hands-on
    - Good for HR checkboxes

**Note:** Books + practical experience may be more valuable than certs depending on career goals.

## üö´ What's Missing? Critical Gaps to Address

### 1. Active Directory / Windows Security

**Why It Matters:** Most enterprise environments run on AD  
**When to Add:** After Phase 3  
**Resource Suggestions:**

- Look for AD exploitation content
- Practice with Bloodhound, PowerView
- Study Kerberos attacks (Golden/Silver tickets)

### 2. Binary Exploitation / Reverse Engineering

**Why It Matters:** Low-level exploitation, malware analysis  
**Current Status:** Not in current roadmap (intentional)  
**Decision:** Skip unless specific interest emerges  
**Alternative:** Your Rust knowledge gives you systems understanding

### 3. Wireless Security

**Why It Matters:** Physical security assessments  
**Current Status:** Not covered  
**Decision:** Skip unless needed for specific role

### 4. Mobile Application Security (iOS/Android)

**Why It Matters:** Mobile apps are everywhere  
**Current Status:** Not covered  
**Decision:** Consider if relevant to work, otherwise skip

### 5. Hands-On Lab Time

**Critical:** Books alone are insufficient  
**Action Items:**

- Set up home lab NOW (even basic VirtualBox setup)
- Practice alongside reading, not after
- Budget lab time equal to reading time

### 6. Community Engagement

**Why It Matters:** Learning alone is hard, community accelerates growth  
**Action Items:**

- Join Discord servers (HackTheBox, Security communities)
- Follow security researchers
- Participate in writeup discussions
