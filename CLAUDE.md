## Main Section (H2) - Major topics
### Subsection (H3) - Subtopics
#### Detail (H4) - Fine-grained points
```

### 3. Lists and Structure

**Checkbox Lists for Learning:**
```markdown
- [x] Completed/understood
- [ ] To learn

## 💡 Enhancement Patterns

### Pattern 1: Add Mental Models
**Before:**
```markdown
MAC addresses are 48 bits.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Mental Model
> Think of MAC addresses like **house numbers** on a street - they identify specific devices on a local network segment.

**Technical Details:**
- Size: 48 bits
- Format: 12 hex digits
```

### Pattern 2: Structure Questions
**Before:**
```markdown
How does this work? Need to research more.
```

**After:**
```markdown
> [!question]- How does packet forwarding work across hops?
> **Research:**
> - What changes at each hop?
> - What stays constant end-to-end?
> - Draw a diagram to visualize
>
> **Resources:**
> - [Practical Networking @ 8:30](https://link.com)
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Detail
**Before:**
```markdown
IP addresses identify hosts.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## IP Addresses: Global Routing

**Purpose:** Identify hosts across networks for end-to-end delivery

### Quick Facts
- **Size:** 32 bits (IPv4)
- **Format:** 4 octets (0-255)
- **Example:** `192.168.1.100`

### Binary Representation
```
192     .  168     .  1       .  100
11000000   10101000   00000001   01100100
```

### Mental Model
> Like a **postal address** - works globally, unlike MAC addresses which are local
```

### Pattern 4: Create Reference Tables
**Before:**
```markdown
Layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
```

**After:**
```markdown
## 📊 Quick Reference: OSI Layer Stack

| Layer | Name | Function | Key Tech | Addressing |
|-------|------|----------|----------|------------|
| 7 | Application | User protocols | HTTP, DNS | - |
| 4 | Transport | Reliability | TCP, UDP | Ports |
| 3 | Network | E2E Delivery | Routers | IP |
| 2 | Data Link | Hop-to-Hop | Switches | MAC |
| 1 | Physical | Transport Bits | Cables | - |

> 💡 **Mnemonic:** Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
```

### Pattern 5: Track Progress
**Before:**
```markdown
[Raw notes about concepts]
```

**After:**
```markdown
## 📝 Study Notes

### Key Takeaways
1. ✅ Layer 1 transports raw bits
2. ✅ Layer 2 uses MAC addresses for hop-to-hop
3. ⏳ Still learning how layers interact
4. ❓ Unclear on routing tables

### Next Steps
- [ ] Watch ARP deep dive video
- [ ] Draw network diagram
- [ ] Practice subnetting calculations
```

## 📚 Example: Before & After

### Before
```markdown
ARP maps IP to MAC. Need to learn more about how it works.
Link: https://example.com
```

### After
```markdown
## ARP: The Layer 2 ↔ Layer 3 Translator

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** bridges Layer 2 and Layer 3:

### What It Does
- Maps IP addresses → MAC addresses
- Allows devices to find the physical address for a logical address

### Mental Model
> Like looking up someone's apartment number (MAC) when you know their mailing address (IP)

### 🤔 Questions to Explore

> [!question]- How does the ARP process work step-by-step?
> Need to research:
> - ARP request/reply mechanism
> - ARP cache/table
> - ARP spoofing attacks
>
> **Resource:** [Practical Networking ARP Deep Dive](https://example.com)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Watch full ARP video
- [ ] Draw ARP request/reply diagram
- [ ] Understand ARP cache timeout
```

**Progress**: ___/XXX questions completed
**Last reviewed**: _______________
```

### When to Use Question Logs

**Create a Question Log when:**
1. You've completed a major topic/module
2. You have 20+ concepts to test yourself on
3. The material has practical applications
4. You need spaced repetition review

**Organization Patterns:**

**By Topic Hierarchy:**
```markdown
## 📚 High-Level Concepts
### Basic Understanding
### Advanced Understanding

## 🔧 Technical Details
### Implementation
### Edge Cases
```

**By Difficulty:**
```markdown
## 🟢 Beginner Questions
## 🟡 Intermediate Questions
## 🔴 Advanced Questions
## 🎓 Mastery Questions
```

**By Question Type:**
```markdown
## 📖 Definitions
## 🎯 Scenarios
## 🔄 Comparisons
## 🛠️ Practical Application
## 🔐 Security Implications
```

### Question Types to Include

#### 1. Simple Recall
```markdown
- [ ] What is a MAC address?
- [ ] How many bits in an IPv4 address?
```

#### 2. Scenario-Based
```markdown
- [ ] **Scenario:** You have 3 switches with 8 computers each.
      How many collision domains exist?
```

#### 3. Comparison Questions
```markdown
- [ ] Compare Layer 2 switches vs Layer 3 routers (5 differences)
```

#### 4. Step-by-Step Process
```markdown
- [ ] Trace the complete journey of a packet from PC A (192.168.1.10)
      to web server (8.8.8.8). Include all layers and transformations.
```

#### 5. Troubleshooting
```markdown
- [ ] Network is slow and degrading. What are 3 possible causes and
      how would you diagnose each?
```

#### 6. Design Questions
```markdown
- [ ] Design a network for 100 employees across 3 departments that
      shouldn't see each other's traffic. What devices do you need?
```

#### 7. Security-Focused (Important!)
```markdown
- [ ] What is a CAM overflow attack? How does it work?
- [ ] What are 3 mitigations for ARP spoofing?
- [ ] Name 5 attacks possible with physical switch port access
```

### Advanced: Questions with Answers (Accordion Pattern)

Use collapsible callouts for complex questions with detailed answers:

```markdown
> [!question]- How does the three-way TCP handshake work?
> **Question:**
> Explain the TCP three-way handshake step-by-step, including SYN,
> SYN-ACK, ACK. What information is exchanged?
>
> **Answer:**
>
> **Step 1 - SYN:**
> - Client sends SYN packet with initial sequence number (ISN)
> - Client: "I want to connect, my sequence number is X"
>
> **Step 2 - SYN-ACK:**
> - Server responds with SYN-ACK
> - Acknowledges client's ISN (X+1)
> - Sends its own ISN (Y)
> - Server: "OK, I got X. My sequence number is Y"
>
> **Step 3 - ACK:**
> - Client sends ACK
> - Acknowledges server's ISN (Y+1)
> - Connection established
> - Client: "Got it, ready to send data"
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> - Establishes bidirectional communication
> - Prevents connection hijacking (sequence numbers)
> - SYN floods exploit this (don't send final ACK)
>
> **Diagram:**
> ```mermaid
> sequenceDiagram
>     Client->>Server: SYN (seq=X)
>     Server->>Client: SYN-ACK (seq=Y, ack=X+1)
>     Client->>Server: ACK (ack=Y+1)
> ```
>
> **Security Implications:**
> - SYN flood attacks exhaust server resources
> - Mitigation: SYN cookies
```

### Template: Generate Question Log from Notes

**Prompt for Claude:**

```
I've completed my notes on [Topic Name]. Generate a comprehensive
Question Log using the pattern from CLAUDE.md.

Requirements:
1. Extract key concepts from the notes
2. Create questions at multiple difficulty levels
3. Include scenario-based and practical questions
4. Add security-focused questions where relevant
5. Use collapsible accordions for complex questions with answers
6. Organize by subtopic and difficulty
7. Include completion tracking section

Source notes: [[Link to completed notes]]

Format: Follow the Question Log pattern in CLAUDE.md
```

### Example Workflow

**Step 1:** Complete study notes
```markdown
# 2. OSI Model.md (completed)
```

**Step 2:** Generate Question Log
```markdown
# 2. OSI Model - Question Log.md

> [!abstract] Learning Guide
> Test your understanding of the OSI 7-layer model

## 🔌 Layer 1 - Physical

### Basic Understanding
- [ ] What is the purpose of Layer 1?
- [ ] Name 3 Layer 1 technologies
- [ ] What does a repeater do?

> [!question]- Why can't hubs operate in full-duplex mode?
> **Answer:**
> Hubs broadcast all traffic to all ports simultaneously.
> Full-duplex requires dedicated bandwidth per device.
> Hubs create a single collision domain where CSMA/CD is required.
>
> **Real-World Impact:**
> - Hubs are obsolete (replaced by switches)
> - Switches provide full-duplex via microsegmentation

## 🔗 Layer 2 - Data Link

### MAC Addresses
- [ ] What is a MAC address? How many bits?
- [ ] How is MAC formatting different on Windows vs Unix?

> [!question]- Why do we need both MAC and IP addresses?
> **Short Answer:**
> MAC = hop-to-hop (local delivery)
> IP = end-to-end (global routing)
>
> **Detailed Explanation:**
> [Include the explanation from notes]
>
> **Analogy:**
> IP = postal address (city, street, house)
> MAC = apartment number (within building)
```

**Step 3:** Review with Spaced Repetition

> Address Resolution Protocol - maps IP to MAC addresses

> [!question]- Level 2: How does ARP work?
> 1. Host needs MAC for an IP
> 2. Broadcasts ARP request
> 3. Target replies with MAC
> 4. Cached in ARP table

> [!question]- Level 3: What are ARP security risks?
> - ARP spoofing/poisoning
