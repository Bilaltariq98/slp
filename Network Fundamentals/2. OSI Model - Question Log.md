## 🔌 Layer 1 - Physical

### Basic Understanding
- [ ] What is the primary purpose of Layer 1?
- [ ] Name at least 3 types of physical media used at Layer 1
- [ ] What data format does Layer 1 transport?
- [ ] Does Layer 1 use any form of addressing? Why or why not?
- [ ] What is the difference between a hub and a repeater?

### Intermediate Questions
- [ ] Explain the difference between half-duplex and full-duplex communication
- [ ] Why are hubs considered obsolete in modern networks?
- [ ] What factors affect the maximum distance of a cable run?
- [ ] Compare twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables (3 differences each)

### Advanced/Scenario-Based
- [ ] **Scenario:** Network speeds are much slower than expected. What Layer 1 issues would you check first?
- [ ] **Scenario:** You need to connect two buildings 500 meters apart. What cable type would you choose and why?
- [ ] Explain CSMA/CD and why it's necessary in half-duplex networks

> [!question]- Why can't hubs operate in full-duplex mode?
> **Question:**
> Hubs are Layer 1 devices that have been replaced by switches. Explain why hubs cannot support full-duplex communication and what this means for network performance.
>
> **Answer:**
>
> **Technical Explanation:**
> - Hubs broadcast all incoming traffic to ALL connected ports simultaneously
> - This creates a single **collision domain** where only one device can transmit at a time
> - Full-duplex requires dedicated bandwidth where devices can send and receive simultaneously
> - Since all hub ports share the same electrical bus, simultaneous transmission causes signal collisions
>
> **Real-World Impact:**
> - Hubs force networks into half-duplex mode (one direction at a time)
> - Requires CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)
> - Significantly reduces effective bandwidth (50% theoretical max)
> - Modern switches provide full-duplex via microsegmentation (dedicated collision domains)
>
> **Performance Comparison:**
> ```
> Hub (Half-Duplex):
> • 100 Mbps port = 50 Mbps effective (one direction at a time)
> • All ports share bandwidth
> • Collisions reduce performance further
>
> Switch (Full-Duplex):
> • 100 Mbps port = 100 Mbps send + 100 Mbps receive
> • Each port has dedicated bandwidth
> • No collisions possible
> ```
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> - Understanding collision domains is crucial for network design
> - Switches are now standard because they eliminate this limitation
> - Some legacy industrial equipment may still use hubs

## 🔗 Layer 2 - Data Link

### Basic Understanding
- [ ] What is the purpose of Layer 2?
- [ ] What does "hop-to-hop" delivery mean?
- [ ] How many bits are in a MAC address?
- [ ] What is the format of a MAC address?
- [ ] Name 3 Layer 2 technologies or devices

### MAC Addresses
- [ ] Are MAC addresses globally unique? How is this guaranteed?
- [ ] What is the difference between the first 24 bits and last 24 bits of a MAC address?
- [ ] Compare MAC address formatting on Windows vs UNIX vs Cisco devices

- [ ] Draw a diagram showing how MAC addresses change across 3 hops while IP addresses stay constant

> [!question]- Why do we need both MAC addresses AND IP addresses?
>
> ## Question
> This is one of the most fundamental networking concepts. Explain why both Layer 2 (MAC) and Layer 3 (IP) addressing are necessary.
>
> ## Short Answer
> - **MAC addresses:** Hop-to-hop delivery (local, changes every hop)
> - **IP addresses:** End-to-end delivery (global, stays constant)
>
> ## Detailed Explanation
>
> **The Problem:**
> Data needs to travel from your PC (192.168.1.10) to a web server (172.217.14.196) across multiple networks and routers.
>
> **Why IP Addresses (Layer 3):**
> - **Hierarchical structure:** Like postal addresses (country/city/street/house)
> - **Routable:** Routers use IP addresses to make forwarding decisions
> - **End-to-end:** Source and destination IP never change during the journey
> - **Scalable:** IP prefixes allow route aggregation (one route can represent millions of hosts)
>
> **Why MAC Addresses (Layer 2):**
> - **Flat structure:** Like serial numbers (no hierarchy)
> - **Local delivery:** Switches use MAC addresses to forward frames on local networks
> - **Hop-by-hop:** MAC addresses change at every router/switch
> - **Hardware-based:** Burned into NICs, allows Layer 2 forwarding without Layer 3 processing
>
> **The Journey:**
> ```
> PC A → Switch → Router 1 → ISP → Router 2 → Switch → Server B
>
> Hop 1 (PC → Switch):
>   SRC MAC: PC_MAC       | DST MAC: SWITCH_MAC
>   SRC IP: 192.168.1.10  | DST IP: 172.217.14.196  ✅ Constant
>
> Hop 2 (Switch → Router 1):
>   SRC MAC: SWITCH_MAC   | DST MAC: ROUTER1_MAC    ⚡ Changed!
>   SRC IP: 192.168.1.10  | DST IP: 172.217.14.196  ✅ Constant
>
> Hop 3 (Router 1 → ISP):
>   SRC MAC: R1_WAN_MAC   | DST MAC: ISP_MAC        ⚡ Changed!
>   SRC IP: 192.168.1.10  | DST IP: 172.217.14.196  ✅ Constant
>
> [... more hops ...]
>
> Final Hop (Switch → Server):
>   SRC MAC: SWITCH_MAC   | DST MAC: SERVER_MAC     ⚡ Changed!
>   SRC IP: 192.168.1.10  | DST IP: 172.217.14.196  ✅ Constant
> ```
>
> ## Analogy
>
> **Sending a Package Across the Country:**
>
> | Aspect | IP Address | MAC Address |
> |--------|-----------|-------------|
> | Purpose | Postal address on package | Delivery truck license plate |
> | Scope | Global (end-to-end) | Local (current segment) |
> | Changes? | Never | Every delivery truck handoff |
> | Used by | Post office routing | Local delivery drivers |
>
> **The postal address (IP)** stays on the package from sender to recipient, allowing postal workers to route it across the country.
>
> **The delivery truck (MAC)** changes at each depot - NYC truck → sorting facility → regional truck → local truck → final delivery van.
>
> ## Why Not Just Use One?
>
> **If we only used MAC addresses:**
> - ❌ Routers would need tables with every MAC address in the world (billions!)
> - ❌ No hierarchical routing (can't aggregate routes)
> - ❌ No way to route across networks efficiently
>
> **If we only used IP addresses:**
> - ❌ Every device would need to process Layer 3 headers (too slow for switches)
> - ❌ Local networks would be inefficient
> - ❌ Hardware-based switching wouldn't be possible
>
> ## Key Insight
>
> **Two-layer addressing allows:**
> 1. **Efficient global routing** (IP - routers use prefixes to aggregate routes)
> 2. **Fast local switching** (MAC - switches forward in hardware without Layer 3 lookup)
> 3. **Separation of concerns** (routing vs switching are different problems)
>
> ## Related Concepts
> - [[ARP]] - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
> - [[Routing tables]] - Use IP addresses for forwarding decisions
> - [[Switch MAC table]] - Maps MAC addresses to physical ports

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- [ ] What problem does ARP solve?
- [ ] Describe the ARP request/reply process
- [ ] What is an ARP cache/table?
- [ ] How long do ARP entries typically last?

> [!question]- How does ARP work step-by-step?
>
> ## Question
> Explain the complete ARP process when a host needs to send data to an IP address on the same local network.
>
> ## Scenario
> PC A (192.168.1.10 / MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA) wants to send data to PC B (192.168.1.20 / MAC: ???)
>
> ## Step-by-Step Process
>
> **Step 1: Check ARP Cache**
> ```
> PC A thinks: "I need to send data to 192.168.1.20"
> PC A checks: "Do I have the MAC address cached?"
> Command: arp -a
> Result: Not found in cache
> ```
>
> **Step 2: Broadcast ARP Request**
> ```
> PC A broadcasts to ALL devices on local network:
>
> ARP Request Frame:
> • Source MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA
> • Dest MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (broadcast)
> • Message: "Who has IP 192.168.1.20? Tell 192.168.1.10"
>
> All devices receive this request
> ```
>
> **Step 3: Target Responds**
> ```
> PC B recognizes its IP address and responds:
>
> ARP Reply Frame:
> • Source MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB
> • Dest MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA (unicast to PC A)
> • Message: "192.168.1.20 is at BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB"
>
> Only PC A receives this reply
> ```
>
> **Step 4: Cache the Mapping**
> ```
> PC A saves to ARP cache:
> 192.168.1.20 → BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB
>
> Typical cache timeout: 2-20 minutes
> Future packets to .20 use cached MAC (no ARP needed)
> ```
>
> **Step 5: Send Original Data**
> ```
> Now PC A can send the actual data:
>
> Ethernet Frame:
> • Source MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA
> • Dest MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB ✅ Now known!
> • IP Packet inside with source/dest IPs
> ```
>
> ## Visual Diagram
> ```
>     PC A                  Switch                  PC B

> ## What Gets Cached
> ```
> arp -a output:
>
> Interface: 192.168.1.10
> Internet Address    Physical Address      Type
> 192.168.1.1        A1-B2-C3-D4-E5-F6    dynamic
> 192.168.1.20       BB-BB-BB-BB-BB-BB    dynamic
> 192.168.1.255      FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF    static (broadcast)
> ```
>
> ## Important Edge Cases
>
> **Case 1: Destination on Different Network**
> - If destination IP is NOT on local subnet, PC sends to **default gateway (router)** MAC instead
> - ARP resolves gateway's IP → MAC
> - Router handles forwarding to remote network
>
> **Case 2: Gratuitous ARP**
> - Device announces its own IP/MAC mapping without being asked
> - Used when IP address changes or NIC comes online
> - Updates all neighbors' ARP caches
>
> **Case 3: ARP Cache Poisoning (Security)**
> - Attacker sends fake ARP replies
> - Victims cache attacker's MAC for someone else's IP
> - Results in Man-in-the-Middle attack
>
> ## Why This Matters
> - ARP is the "glue" between Layer 2 and Layer 3
> - Without ARP, IP addresses couldn't find MAC addresses on local networks
> - Understanding ARP is crucial for troubleshooting connectivity issues
> - ARP vulnerabilities are a major security concern

>
> ## The Answer
>
> ### ✅ Stays Constant (End-to-End)

> ```
> Layer 2 (Ethernet Frame):
> • SRC MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA (PC A)
> • DST MAC: 11:11:11:11:11:11 (Switch 1)
>

> Layer 2:
> • SRC MAC: 11:11:11:11:11:11 (Switch 1)      ⚡ Changed
> • DST MAC: 22:22:22:22:22:22 (Router 1 LAN)  ⚡ Changed
>
> Layer 3:
> • SRC IP: 192.168.1.10        ✅ Unchanged
> • DST IP: 172.217.14.196      ✅ Unchanged
> • TTL: 64                      (No change yet - switch is L2 only)
> ```

>
> Layer 3:
> • SRC IP: 192.168.1.10        ✅ Unchanged
> • DST IP: 172.217.14.196      ✅ Unchanged
> • TTL: 63                      ⚡ Decremented by Router 1
> ```
>
> ### Hop 4: ISP Router → Next Router
> ```
> Layer 2:
> • SRC MAC: 44:44:44:44:44:44 (ISP Router)    ⚡ Changed
> • DST MAC: 55:55:55:55:55:55 (Next Router)   ⚡ Changed
>
> Layer 3:
> • SRC IP: 192.168.1.10        ✅ Unchanged
> • DST IP: 172.217.14.196      ✅ Unchanged
> • TTL: 62                      ⚡ Decremented
> ```
>
> ### Final Hop: Switch 2 → Server
> ```
> Layer 2:
> • SRC MAC: 77:77:77:77:77:77 (Switch 2)      ⚡ Changed
> • DST MAC: DD:DD:DD:DD:DD:DD (Server)        ⚡ Changed (finally!)

>
> ## Summary Table
>
> | Field | Stays Constant? | Layer | Changes At |
> |-------|----------------|-------|------------|
> | Source IP | ✅ Yes | 3 | Never |
> | Destination IP | ✅ Yes | 3 | Never |
> | Source Port | ✅ Yes | 4 | Never |
> | Destination Port | ✅ Yes | 4 | Never |
> | Application Data | ✅ Yes | 5-7 | Never |
> | Source MAC | ❌ No | 2 | Every hop |
> | Destination MAC | ❌ No | 2 | Every hop |
> | TTL | ❌ No | 3 | Every router (L3 device) |
> | Frame Check Sequence | ❌ No | 2 | Every hop |
>
> ## Why This Design?
>
> **Layer 3 (IP) - End-to-End:**
> - Stays constant so routers know the ultimate destination
> - Allows global routing across the entire Internet
> - Hierarchical addressing enables route aggregation
>
> **Layer 2 (MAC) - Hop-to-Hop:**
> - Changes to reflect current network segment
> - Enables fast hardware-based switching
> - Only needs to know "next hop" not final destination
>
> **TTL (Time To Live):**
> - Decrements to prevent infinite routing loops
> - If packet gets stuck in a loop, TTL reaches 0 and packet is dropped
> - Typical starting values: 64 (Linux), 128 (Windows), 255 (some routers)
>
> ## Common Misconceptions
>
> ❌ **Wrong:** "MAC addresses stay the same because they're burned into the NIC"
> ✅ **Right:** "MAC addresses in the frame header change at each hop - only the NIC's own MAC is permanent"
>
> ❌ **Wrong:** "Switches change IP addresses"
> ✅ **Right:** "Switches operate at Layer 2 and don't modify IP headers - only routers process Layer 3"
>
> ❌ **Wrong:** "TTL is a time value in seconds"
> ✅ **Right:** "TTL is a hop count, not time - it decrements by 1 at each router"
>
> ## Troubleshooting Applications
>
> **Using traceroute/tracert:**
> - Sends packets with increasing TTL values (1, 2, 3, ...)
> - Each router that decrements TTL to 0 sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message
> - Reveals the path packets take to reach a destination
>
> **Wireshark capture analysis:**
> - Filter by IP address to follow a specific conversation
> - Watch TTL decrease to identify number of router hops
> - Examine MAC addresses to see local network path

> [!question]- Explain the TCP three-way handshake
>
> ## Question
> Describe the TCP three-way handshake process that establishes a connection between client and server. Include what information is exchanged and why each step is necessary.
>
> ## Quick Answer
> 1. **SYN** - Client initiates connection with sequence number
> 2. **SYN-ACK** - Server acknowledges and sends its sequence number
> 3. **ACK** - Client acknowledges server's sequence number
>
> ## Detailed Step-by-Step
>
> ### Setup
> ```
> Client: 192.168.1.10:54321 (random ephemeral port)
> Server: 172.217.14.196:443 (HTTPS)
> ```
>
> ### Step 1: SYN (Synchronize)
> ```
> Client → Server
>
> TCP Header:
> • Source Port: 54321
> • Dest Port: 443
> • Sequence Number: 1000 (random initial sequence number)
> • Acknowledgment: 0
> • Flags: SYN = 1
>
> Message: "Hello server! I want to connect. My sequence number starts at 1000."
> ```
>
> **Purpose:**
> - Client announces intention to connect
> - Provides Initial Sequence Number (ISN) for tracking data bytes
> - SYN flag indicates this is a connection request
>
> ### Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)
> ```
> Server → Client
>
> TCP Header:
> • Source Port: 443
> • Dest Port: 54321
> • Sequence Number: 5000 (server's random ISN)
> • Acknowledgment: 1001 (client's ISN + 1)
> • Flags: SYN = 1, ACK = 1
>
> Message: "Hi client! I got your request. My sequence starts at 5000.
>           I acknowledge your sequence 1000 and expect 1001 next."
> ```
>
> **Purpose:**
> - Server acknowledges client's SYN
> - Server provides its own ISN
> - Server confirms it's ready to communicate
> - ACK number = client's ISN + 1
>
> ### Step 3: ACK (Acknowledge)
> ```
> Client → Server
>
> TCP Header:
> • Source Port: 54321
> • Dest Port: 443
> • Sequence Number: 1001
> • Acknowledgment: 5001 (server's ISN + 1)
> • Flags: ACK = 1
>
> Message: "Got it! I acknowledge your sequence 5000 and expect 5001 next.
>           Connection established - sending data now..."
> ```
>
> **Purpose:**
> - Client acknowledges server's SYN-ACK
> - Connection is now fully established (ESTABLISHED state)
> - Data transmission can begin
>

> ## Why Three Steps? Why Not Two?
>
> **Problem with 2-way handshake:**
> - Server has no confirmation that client received the SYN-ACK
> - If SYN-ACK is lost, server would wait forever
> - Old duplicate SYN packets could establish unwanted connections
>
> **Benefits of 3-way handshake:**
> - ✅ Both sides confirm they can send AND receive
> - ✅ Both sides agree on initial sequence numbers
> - ✅ Prevents old duplicate packets from creating connections
> - ✅ Establishes bidirectional communication
>
> ## Sequence Numbers Purpose
>
> ```
> After handshake, data transmission uses sequence numbers:
>
> Client sends 100 bytes:
>   SEQ = 1001, Data = 100 bytes
>
> Server acknowledges:
>   ACK = 1101 (expecting next byte at position 1101)
>
> Client sends 200 more bytes:
>   SEQ = 1101, Data = 200 bytes
>
> Server acknowledges:
>   ACK = 1301
> ```
>
> **Why sequence numbers?**
> - Track every byte of data
> - Detect missing packets (gap in sequence)
> - Detect duplicate packets (already received this sequence)
> - Reorder out-of-order packets
> - Ensure reliable delivery
>
> ## Security Implications
>
> ### SYN Flood Attack (DDoS)
> ```
> Attacker sends thousands of SYN packets with fake source IPs:
>
> Attacker → Server: SYN, SYN, SYN, SYN... (flood)
> Server → Fake IPs: SYN-ACK, SYN-ACK, SYN-ACK...
> Server waits for ACK that never comes (half-open connections)
>
> Result: Server's connection table fills up, denies legitimate clients
> ```
>
> **Mitigations:**
> - **SYN Cookies:** Server doesn't allocate resources until final ACK
> - **Firewall rate limiting:** Limit SYN packets per source
> - **Increase backlog queue:** Allow more half-open connections
>
> ### Connection Hijacking
> - Attacker predicts sequence numbers
> - Injects packets that appear to be part of established connection
> - Modern systems use random ISNs to prevent this
>
> ## TCP States During Handshake
>
> | Step | Client State | Server State |
> |------|-------------|--------------|
> | Initial | CLOSED | LISTEN |
> | After SYN sent | SYN_SENT | LISTEN |
> | After SYN-ACK sent | SYN_SENT | SYN_RECEIVED |
> | After ACK sent | ESTABLISHED | SYN_RECEIVED |
> | After ACK received | ESTABLISHED | ESTABLISHED |
>
> **View with:** `netstat -an` or `ss -tan` (Linux)
>
> ## Four-Way Termination (Bonus)
>
> Closing a connection is similar but requires 4 steps:
> ```
> 1. Client → Server: FIN (I'm done sending)
> 2. Server → Client: ACK (OK, I received that)
> 3. Server → Client: FIN (I'm done too)
> 4. Client → Server: ACK (OK, closing now)
> ```
>
> **Why 4 steps?**
> - TCP is full-duplex (independent send/receive channels)
> - Each direction must be closed separately
> - Server might still have data to send after receiving FIN
>
> ## Common Issues
>
> **Problem:** Connection hangs at SYN_SENT
> - Firewall blocking port
> - Server not listening on that port
> - Network connectivity issue
>
> **Problem:** Many connections in SYN_RECEIVED
> - Possible SYN flood attack
> - Network congestion dropping ACK packets
> - Check firewall logs
>
> ## Why This Matters
>
> Understanding TCP handshake is critical for:
> - **Troubleshooting:** Connection timeouts, slow connections
> - **Security:** Recognizing SYN flood attacks, firewall rules
> - **Performance:** Reducing handshake overhead (TCP Fast Open)
> - **Monitoring:** Interpreting netstat, Wireshark captures

### Advanced/Scenario-Based
- [ ] **Scenario:** You have Chrome with 3 tabs open to the same website (https://bank.com). How does Layer 4 distinguish which tab gets which data?
- [ ] **Scenario:** A gaming application is laggy despite fast internet. Would switching from TCP to UDP help? Why?
- [ ] Explain how port forwarding works on a home router

> [!question]- How do ephemeral ports work?
>
> ## Question
> When you open multiple browser tabs to the same website, how does your computer keep track of which response goes to which tab? Explain ephemeral ports.
>
> ## Scenario
> ```
> Your PC: 192.168.1.100
> You open 3 Chrome tabs to https://bank.com (172.217.14.196:443)
> All tabs connect to the same destination IP and port
> How does the OS know which response belongs to which tab?
> ```
>
> ## Answer: Ephemeral Ports
>
> **Ephemeral ports** are temporary, randomly-assigned client-side ports used to distinguish multiple connections to the same server.
>
> ### Port Ranges
> ```
> 0 - 1023:       Well-known ports (HTTP=80, HTTPS=443, SSH=22)
> 1024 - 49151:   Registered ports (application-specific)
> 49152 - 65535:  Ephemeral/Dynamic ports (client-side random)
> ```
>
> ### How It Works
> ```
> Tab 1 opens https://bank.com:
> • Client: 192.168.1.100:54321 → Server: 172.217.14.196:443
>   OS assigns random port 54321
>
> Tab 2 opens https://bank.com:
> • Client: 192.168.1.100:54322 → Server: 172.217.14.196:443
>   OS assigns different random port 54322
>
> Tab 3 opens https://bank.com:
> • Client: 192.168.1.100:54323 → Server: 172.217.14.196:443
>   OS assigns different random port 54323
> ```
>
> ### The 5-Tuple
> Each TCP connection is uniquely identified by 5 values:
> ```
> 1. Source IP
> 2. Source Port        ← This is what differs!
> 3. Destination IP
> 4. Destination Port
> 5. Protocol (TCP/UDP)
> ```
>
> **Example:**
> ```
> Connection 1: (192.168.1.100, 54321, 172.217.14.196, 443, TCP)
> Connection 2: (192.168.1.100, 54322, 172.217.14.196, 443, TCP)
> Connection 3: (192.168.1.100, 54323, 172.217.14.196, 443, TCP)
>
> Three different connections despite same destination!
> ```
>
> ## Visual Flow
> ```
>     Your PC (192.168.1.100)              Bank Server (172.217.14.196:443)

> ## Server Perspective
> ```
> Server sees three separate connections:
>
> netstat -an | grep :443
> tcp  0  0  172.217.14.196:443  192.168.1.100:54321  ESTABLISHED
> tcp  0  0  172.217.14.196:443  192.168.1.100:54322  ESTABLISHED
> tcp  0  0  172.217.14.196:443  192.168.1.100:54323  ESTABLISHED
> ```
>
> Each connection is independent, tracked separately by the kernel.
>
> ## Operating System Management
>
> **Port Assignment:**
> - OS maintains a pool of available ephemeral ports
> - When application requests outbound connection, OS assigns unused port
> - Port is released when connection closes
>
> **Port Exhaustion:**
> ```
> Maximum connections from one IP to one server:port?
>
> Ephemeral port range: ~16,000 ports (49152-65535)
> Answer: ~16,000 simultaneous connections
>
> If you need more: Use multiple source IPs or connection pooling
> ```
>
> ## Real-World Examples
>
> ### Web Browsing
> ```
> Browser process manages multiple tabs:
> • Tab 1 → google.com:443 (port 54321)
> • Tab 2 → youtube.com:443 (port 54322)
> • Tab 3 → google.com:443 (port 54323) ← Same destination!
>
> Browser correlates responses to tabs using source port
> ```
>
> ### API Requests
> ```
> Your app makes 100 API calls to api.example.com:
> • Request 1: source port 50000
> • Request 2: source port 50001
> • ...
> • Request 100: source port 50099
>
> Each response is matched to the correct callback using port number
> ```
>
> ### Database Connections
> ```
> App server with connection pool to database:
> • Connection 1: app:55001 → db:3306
> • Connection 2: app:55002 → db:3306
> • ...
> • Connection 10: app:55010 → db:3306
>
> Pool maintains mapping of ports to query contexts
> ```
>
> ## How Response Routing Works
>
> **Outbound packet (request):**
> ```
> SRC: 192.168.1.100:54321
> DST: 172.217.14.196:443
> ```
>
> **Inbound packet (response):**
> ```
> SRC: 172.217.14.196:443
> DST: 192.168.1.100:54321  ← OS uses this to route to correct app!
> ```
>
> **OS routing logic:**
> ```
> 1. Packet arrives at network interface
> 2. OS reads destination port: 54321
> 3. Looks up socket table: port 54321 → Chrome tab 1 process
> 4. Delivers data to that process's receive buffer
> 5. Chrome tab 1 reads data and renders response
> ```
>
> ## Port States
>
> View active connections:
> ```bash
> # Linux/Mac
> netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
> ss -tupn
> lsof -i :54321
>
> # Windows
> netstat -an | findstr ESTABLISHED
> ```
>
> ## Why This Matters
>
> **Troubleshooting:**
> - "Too many open files" error = port exhaustion
> - Connection not reused = new ephemeral port each time
> - Load balancing must consider 5-tuple, not just destination
>
> **Security:**
> - Port scanning looks for open ports
> - Firewall rules can block ephemeral port ranges
> - NAT router must track ephemeral ports for translation
>
> **Performance:**
> - Connection pooling reuses ports (more efficient)
> - HTTP/2 multiplexes requests over one connection (one port)
> - WebSockets keep connection open (port held longer)

> ## Time Breakdown (Approximate)
> ```
> Total time: ~50-200ms (depending on distance)
>
> • Layers 7-4 (client): <1ms (CPU processing)
> • Layers 3-1 (client): <1ms (network stack)
> • Physical transmission: 10-100ms (network latency)
> • Routers (multiple hops): 5-50ms (routing delays)
> • Layers 1-7 (server): ~2ms (processing)
> • Return journey: same time
> ```
>
> ## Why This Matters
>
> Understanding this complete flow helps with:
> - **Troubleshooting:** Identify which layer is causing issues
> - **Security:** Understand where encryption happens, where to filter
> - **Performance:** Optimize at the right layer (caching at L7, routing at L3)

>
> ## Layer 2 Attack: ARP Spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle)
>
> ### How It Works
> ```
> Normal ARP:
> PC A: "Who has 192.168.1.1?"
> Router: "I do! My MAC is AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA"
>
> ARP Spoofing:
> PC A: "Who has 192.168.1.1?"
> Attacker: "I do! My MAC is BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB" (FAKE!)
>
> Result: PC A caches attacker's MAC for router's IP
> All traffic intended for router goes to attacker first
> ```
>
> ### Attack Flow
> ```
> 1. Attacker sends fake ARP replies:
>    "192.168.1.1 is at BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB" (attacker's MAC)
>
> 2. PC A updates ARP cache:
>    192.168.1.1 → BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB ❌ Wrong!
>
> 3. PC A sends internet traffic to attacker's MAC
>
> 4. Attacker intercepts, reads, then forwards to real router
>    • Can read/modify all traffic (Man-in-the-Middle)
>    • Can steal credentials, session cookies
>    • Can inject malicious content
> ```
>
> ### Impact
> - Intercept all network traffic from victim
> - Steal passwords, session tokens
> - Modify data in transit
> - Launch further attacks (downgrade HTTPS, phishing)
>
> ### Mitigation
> ```
> ✅ Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
>    • Switch validates ARP packets against DHCP bindings
>    • Drops invalid ARP replies
>
> ✅ Static ARP Entries (critical hosts)
>    • Manually configure gateway's IP→MAC mapping
>    • Cannot be overwritten by fake ARP
>
> ✅ Port Security
>    • Limit MAC addresses per switch port
>    • Prevents attacker from spoofing multiple MACs
>
> ✅ Network Monitoring
>    • Alert on ARP changes for critical hosts
>    • Detect abnormal ARP traffic patterns
>
> ✅ Encryption
>    • Use TLS/SSL (HTTPS, VPN) so intercepted traffic is encrypted
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ## Layer 3/4 Attack: SYN Flood (DDoS)
>
> ### How It Works
> ```
> Normal TCP Handshake:
> Client → Server: SYN
> Server → Client: SYN-ACK
> Client → Server: ACK
> Connection established
>
> SYN Flood Attack:
> Attacker → Server: SYN (fake source IP)
> Server → Fake IP: SYN-ACK (goes to wrong place)
> [No ACK ever comes]
> Server: Waits... connection left half-open
>
> Attacker sends THOUSANDS per second with different fake IPs
> ```
>
> ### Attack Flow
> ```
> 1. Attacker spoofs source IP addresses:
>    SYN from 1.2.3.4
>    SYN from 5.6.7.8
>    SYN from 9.10.11.12
>    ... (thousands per second)
>
> 2. Server sends SYN-ACK to each fake IP:
>    SYN-ACK → 1.2.3.4 (real host, didn't send SYN, confused)
>    SYN-ACK → 5.6.7.8 (maybe offline)
>    SYN-ACK → 9.10.11.12 (receives unexpected packet, ignores)
>
> 3. Server waits for ACK that never comes:
>    • Each half-open connection consumes memory
>    • Fills server's connection backlog queue
>    • After ~60 seconds, timeout and close
>
> 4. New legitimate clients cannot connect:
>    • "Connection refused" or timeout
>    • Service unavailable (DoS achieved)
> ```
>
> ### Impact
> - Server resources exhausted (memory, CPU)
> - Connection table full, cannot accept new connections
> - Legitimate users cannot access service
> - Can take down web servers, email servers, etc.
>
> ### Mitigation
> ```
> ✅ SYN Cookies
>    • Don't allocate resources until final ACK received
>    • Encode connection state in sequence number
>    • Modern Linux/BSD have this enabled by default
>
> ✅ Rate Limiting
>    • Limit SYN packets per source IP
>    • Drop excess SYN packets
>    • Firewall rules: iptables/nftables rate limit
>
> ✅ Increase Backlog Queue
>    • Allow more half-open connections
>    • Buy time for SYN cookies to activate
>    • sysctl: net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog
>
> ✅ Reverse Proxy / CDN
>    • Cloudflare, AWS Shield, Akamai
>    • Absorb attack before reaching origin server
>    • Challenge suspicious sources
>
> ✅ Traffic Analysis
>    • Detect abnormal SYN:ACK ratios
>    • Block source IPs/networks sending floods
>    • BGP blackhole routing for severe attacks
> ```

>
> ## Layer 7 Attack: HTTP Flood (Application DDoS)
>
> ### How It Works
> ```
> Attacker sends legitimate-looking HTTP requests that are
> expensive for the server to process.
>
> Normal request:
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.com
>
> Attack requests:
> POST /search?q=expensive_query HTTP/1.1
> POST /api/report?start_date=2000-01-01&end_date=2025-12-31
> GET /slow_endpoint HTTP/1.1 (requires database query)
>
> Thousands of requests per second to expensive endpoints
> ```
>
> ### Attack Flow
> ```
> 1. Attacker establishes many legitimate TCP connections:
>    • Complete 3-way handshake (looks normal)
>    • Can come from multiple IPs (botnet)
>
> 2. Sends HTTP requests to resource-intensive endpoints:
>    • Search queries with complex regex
>    • Reports that scan entire database
>    • File uploads that fill disk
>    • API calls that trigger expensive calculations
>
> 3. Server processes each request:
>    • CPU usage spikes (complex queries)
>    • Database overwhelmed (slow queries)
>    • Memory fills up (caching, processing)
>    • Disk I/O saturated (logs, uploads)
>
> 4. Legitimate users experience:
>    • Slow response times (seconds to minutes)
>    • Timeouts (503 Service Unavailable)
>    • Application crashes
> ```
>
> ### Why Layer 7 Attacks Are Hard to Stop
> - Look like legitimate traffic (valid HTTP)
> - Complete TCP handshakes (not SYN flood)
> - May come from many IPs (botnet)
> - Difficult to distinguish from real users
> - Abuse application logic (not network layer)
>
> ### Impact
> - Application becomes unresponsive
> - Database overload (slow queries)
> - Server resources exhausted (CPU, memory, disk)
> - Costs increase (cloud auto-scaling, bandwidth)
> - Revenue loss (e-commerce downtime)
>
> ### Mitigation
> ```
> ✅ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
>    • Cloudflare, AWS WAF, ModSecurity
>    • Rate limiting per IP/user
>    • Challenge suspicious requests (CAPTCHA)
>    • Block known bad bots (user-agent, behavior)
>
> ✅ Rate Limiting (Application Level)
>    • Limit requests per IP: 100/minute
>    • Limit expensive operations: 10/hour per user
>    • Return 429 Too Many Requests
>
> ✅ Caching
>    • Cache expensive query results (Redis, Memcached)
>    • CDN for static assets
>    • Reduce database load
>
> ✅ Query Optimization
>    • Add database indexes for common queries
>    • Set query timeouts (kill slow queries)
>    • Limit result set size
>
> ✅ Authentication & Authorization
>    • Require login for expensive operations
>    • Higher rate limits for authenticated users
>    • Block guest/anonymous abuse
>
> ✅ Traffic Analysis & Anomaly Detection
>    • Monitor request patterns
>    • Detect unusual spikes in traffic
>    • Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
>
> ✅ Load Balancing & Auto-scaling
>    • Distribute load across multiple servers
>    • Auto-scale to handle legitimate spikes
>    • Graceful degradation (queue, backpressure)
> ```

> | Aspect | L2 ARP Spoofing | L3/4 SYN Flood | L7 HTTP Flood |
> |--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
> | **Target** | Local network | Network/Transport | Application |
> | **Goal** | Intercept traffic | Exhaust connections | Exhaust resources |
> | **Detectability** | Medium | Easy | Hard |
> | **Mitigation** | DAI, port security | SYN cookies, rate limit | WAF, rate limit, caching |
> | **Scope** | Local network | Network-wide | Application-specific |
> | **Defense Layer** | Switch | Firewall/Router | WAF/Application |
>
> ## Key Insight
>
> Attacks at different layers require different defense strategies:
> - **Lower layers (1-4):** Network devices (switches, firewalls) can help
> - **Upper layers (5-7):** Application-level defenses needed (WAF, code fixes)
> - **Defense in depth:** Use protections at multiple layers

## 🎯 Practical Application

### Troubleshooting Scenarios

> [!question]- Network troubleshooting: Bottom-up approach
>
> **Scenario:** User reports "Website won't load." Walk through systematic troubleshooting using the OSI model.
>
> ## Layer 1 - Physical
> ```
> ✅ Check:
> • Is cable plugged in? (both ends)
> • Are link lights on NIC/switch port?
> • Try different cable?
> • Try different port?
>
> Test: ping 127.0.0.1 (loopback - tests network stack)
>
> If Layer 1 fails: Replace cable, check port, check NIC driver
> ```
>
> ## Layer 2 - Data Link
> ```
> ✅ Check:
> • Is NIC enabled? (ip link show / ifconfig)
> • MAC address present?
> • Can reach other devices on local network?
> • Switch port configured correctly (VLAN, port security)?
>
> Test: arp -a (see if gateway MAC is cached)
>       ping gateway (192.168.1.1)
>
> If Layer 2 fails: Check switch config, VLAN membership, port security
> ```
>
> ## Layer 3 - Network
> ```
> ✅ Check:
> • IP address assigned? (ip addr / ipconfig)
> • Correct subnet?
> • Default gateway configured?
> • Can ping gateway?
> • Can ping external IP (8.8.8.8)?
>
> Test: ping 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
>       traceroute 8.8.8.8 (see routing path)
>
> If Layer 3 fails: Check IP config, routing table, gateway reachability
> ```
>
> ## Layer 4 - Transport
> ```
> ✅ Check:
> • Can establish TCP connection?
> • Firewall blocking port?
> • Is service listening on expected port?
>
> Test: telnet website.com 80
>       nc -zv website.com 443
>       netstat -an | grep :443
>
> If Layer 4 fails: Check firewall rules, port forwarding, service status
> ```
>
> ## Layer 7 - Application
> ```
> ✅ Check:
> • DNS resolving correctly?
> • HTTP status code (404, 500, 502)?
> • Application logs show errors?
> • TLS certificate valid?
>
> Test: nslookup website.com
>       curl -I https://website.com
>       dig website.com
>
> If Layer 7 fails: Check DNS, application logs, server status, proxy config
> ```
>
> ## Decision Tree
> ```
> Website won't load
>    ↓
> Ping 127.0.0.1
>    ├─ Fail → Layer 1/2 (network stack issue)
>    └─ Success → Continue
>          ↓
> Ping gateway (192.168.1.1)
>    ├─ Fail → Layer 2/3 (local network issue)
>    └─ Success → Continue
>          ↓
> Ping 8.8.8.8
>    ├─ Fail → Layer 3 (routing/gateway issue)
>    └─ Success → Continue
>          ↓
> nslookup website.com
>    ├─ Fail → DNS issue (Layer 7)
>    └─ Success → Continue
>          ↓
> curl https://website.com
>    ├─ Timeout → Layer 4 (firewall/port)
>    ├─ 404/500 → Layer 7 (application error)
>    └─ Success → Issue is client-side (browser cache, etc.)
> ```

### Design Questions
- [ ] **Design:** Network for 100 employees across 3 departments that shouldn't see each other's traffic. What devices/layers?
- [ ] **Design:** Real-time video streaming service. Which protocols at each layer would you use?
- [ ] **Design:** Secure remote access solution for employees. Map security controls to OSI layers.

### Analysis Questions
- [ ] Use Wireshark to capture a packet. Identify headers from each layer.
- [ ] Run `traceroute`/`tracert` to a website. How many Layer 3 hops?
- [ ] View `netstat` or `ss` output. Identify Layer 4 information (ports, protocols, states).
